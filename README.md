# How to bypass reCAPTCHA using Python, Javascript, PHP
<p>In our age of automation, most solutions can be freely found available, and I'm not talking about solving math problems right now, but slightly more complex tasks, such as data parsing, and, as in our case, recaptcha recognition. But how do I find a good module? After all, with access to technology, everyone got it, both conscientious developers and outright scammers.</p>
<p>I analyzed the market for captcha recognition modules and I got the top of modules in three popular programming languages. Let's get to the business!</p>
<H2>Modules for solving recaptcha in Python</H2>
<p>The most popular programming language is definitely Python, the code for this programming language is searched in 5 out of 10 cases when people google "How to bypass recaptcha" on the Internet (not taking into account queries that contain the word python, such as "how to bypass recaptcha in python", and so on).</p>
<p>The easiest way to implement all this will be with using modules that just need to be connected in an executable file. After studying the Internet, I have identified the following popular modules with which you can recognize recaptcha (by the way, with all these modules you can recognize other types of captcha):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/2captcha-python/">2captcha-python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/2captcha-solver/">2captcha-solver</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/captchatools/">captchatools</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/twocaptcha-extension-python/">twocaptcha-extension-python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Matthew17-21/Captcha-Tools">Captcha-Tools</a></li>
</ul>
<H2>Python module for 2Captcha to avoid reCAPTCHA (CAPTCHA solver API)</H2>
<p>The official module from the captcha recognition service 2captcha is designed for easy integration with their API. The module has advanced functionality and supports proxy configuration. The module is maintained and regularly updated, and can be used for parsing web resources and automation.</p>
<p>The service is ideal for users that focus on reliability in captcha recognition, as well as those who need official support from the 2captcha service.</p>
<p>The module supports asynchronous operations.</p>
<H2>Google reCAPTCHA solver module for Python</H2>
<p>A module for solving recaptcha and some other popular captchas (reCAPTCHA (v2, v3), FunCaptcha, and hCaptcha). Its main difference from the previous module is that it is more narrowly focused (supports fewer captchas) and can respond less flexibly to updates from the recaptcha, compared with the previous official module.</p>
<p>2Captcha-solver supports proxy configuration and is especially useful for tasks requiring high performance, thanks to its support for asynchronous operations, which allows you to simultaneously solve multiple reCAPTCHAs.</p>
<H2>Module written by Python - reCAPTCHA solver</H2>
<p>A multifunctional module, the main focus of which is on supporting several captcha recognition services. The functionality of the module is approximately similar to the previous two, it supports proxy configuration and asynchronous operations.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that the module allows you to integrate captcha recognition through several services, it has a unique function – brute force search for services. That is, you can use one service as the main one, and others as backup, and when, for example, you run out of funds on the main service, or if the main service could not cope with the task, the captcha will go to the backup one and will be solved. This way your script will be more automated and will not depend on the stability of one particular service.</p>

This way your script will be more automated and will not depend on the stability of one particular service.</p>
<H2>Module for bypass reCAPTCHA by Python (for Selenium)</H2>
<p>It is a narrowly focused module that is used for easy integration with Selenium and Playwright, and supports all types of recaptcha.</p>
<p>The module can be used without the need to install additional extensions and only the API key is required for the start.</p>
<p>Its main difference from the previous modules is that twocaptcha-extension-python will be difficult to use for automation issues where Selenium or Playwright are not used, since it is used exclusively for the listed services.</p>
<H2>Module to bypass reCAPTCHA V2/V3 by Python</H2>
<p>A module that resembles captchatools in functionality, and it can be called an analog of the specified service. That is, you can use one of them by choice.</p>
<p>All the characteristics are the same: support for multiple services, brute force search for services in the process of captcha recognition, asynchronous operations, proxy configuration. It's all here, too. Only the developer is different.</p>
<p>Well, and an assumption from me, most likely both of these services will react a little slower to changes that occur in captcha recognition services and which are made by captcha developers than the official modules.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that all of these services (not just Twocaptcha-extension-python) can be used together with Selenium and Playwright, the only difference will be in connection and synchronization.</p>

<H2>JavaScript and reCAPTCHA, how to bypass reCAPTCHA in Javascript using modules</H2>
<p>The second most popular language for which users are looking to find ways to bypass recaptcha is node js, about 3 out of 10 requests to bypass recaptcha come to this programming language.</p>
<p>As in the case of Python, it is easiest to recognize recaptcha through special modules, especially since captcha recognition services are interested in simplifying work for their customers and many create and maintain such modules, here is a list of the most popular of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/2captcha">2captcha</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/2captcha/2captcha-javascript">2captcha-javascript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/captcha-solver">captcha-solver</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/multi-captcha-solver-adapter?activeTab=readme">multi-captcha-solver-adapter</a></li>
</ul>
<H2>Module to bypass reCAPTCHA using Javascript</H2>
<p>The official module for node js from the captcha recognition service 2captcha, supports most of the known types of captcha, including recaptcha. An important difference between this module and the others is TypeScript support, which makes it convenient for development of various applications.</p>
<p>All basic settings, including asynchronous operations, proxy settings, etc. are present in the module, which makes it a universal module for solving most types of captcha. Well, and the fact that the module was created by the 2captcha service allows us to draw a conclusion about its reliability.</p>
<H2>Javascript module for 2Captcha to pass reCAPTCHA</H2>
<p>It is also the official module for recognizing the main types of captcha from the 2captcha service, and it supports all the same settings as the previous module (with the exception of TypeScript support), but it seemed to me that it was created more with an emphasis on ease of integration and a quick start.</p>
<p>It is easier than the previous one and, like its predecessor, it solves the main task – bypasses recaptcha. So, if you just need your script (program) written in node js to solve recaptcha, use this module, and if you need deeper integration, take a closer look at the previous module.</p>
<H2>Module to bypass Google reCAPTCHA response</H2>
<p>The module is tailored for integration with Puppeteer and allows you to solve recaptcha and other popular types of captcha.</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that this module is tailored for Puppeteer, it provides the opportunity to choose a provider that solves the captcha, which also allows you to configure a brute force search for services (as described in the section about modules for Python).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the two previous modules can be integrated into Puppeteer, but captcha-solver provides an out-of-the-box solution, that is, you set it up and forget about it, whereas in the case of 2captcha and 2captcha-javascript, manual processing of the results or configuring this processing may be required.</p>
<H2>Javascript module to skip reCAPTCHA</H2>
<p>A module from third-party developers that supports the recaptcha solution, as well as some other popular types of captcha. Several captcha recognition services are integrated in the module, which allows you to configure a brute force search for services (make one the main one, and make the rest backup ones)</p>
<p>The service is an alternative to 2captcha and 2captcha-javascript, but there may be delays in updating, since the module is not supported by official services, but otherwise its functionality is similar to its competitors.</p>

<H2>Module wriiten by PHP using reCAPTCHA bypass API</H2>
<p>And the third most popular language for which users are looking to find ways to bypass recaptcha is php. I suggest to start with modules, as in the first two cases, and to end with the code. So, the most popular modules for solving recaptcha in PHP are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/2captcha/2captcha-php/tree/master">2captcha-php</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-captcha-solver">php-captcha-solver</a></li>
</ul>
<H2>Module to reCAPTCHA bypass in Chrome</H2>
<p>This module makes it easy to integrate the 2Captcha API into your PHP CAPTCHA solution code. It supports CAPTCHA types such as reCAPTCHA, FunCaptcha, GeeTest, and others. The module is designed for quick setup and use, including support for text CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA v3. It also supports various methods for working with images and audio files.</p>
<H2>How to recognize reCAPTCHA in PHP</H2>
<p>A module that provides a user-friendly interface for integration with various CAPTCHA services, including 2Captcha. Supports various types of CAPTCHA, such as reCAPTCHA and FunCaptcha. This module is focused on ease of use and quick setup.</p>
<p>In fact, if we compare these two modules, the first one is developed by the 2captcha service, and the second one is made by the developer community, and both solve the same tasks and have approximately the same set of functionality. However, the second module may be less prompt in terms of updates, unlike the official module.</p>
